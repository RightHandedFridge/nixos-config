# NixOS Configuration
This is my NixOS configuration that also uses Home Manager.

## DO NOT USE THIS
This configuration is intended just for me to use, so I will not be providing any support or such if you clone and build it for your own system. Feel free to copy snippets of the configuration for your own configs though, I don't care.
